# Project Title

Webpage Developer Portfolio

# Project Description

This single-page web application is a Portfolio for me to showcase any projects I work upon in the future, and will allow me to demonstrate my abilities as a Software Engineer to potential employees.

The technologies used are HTML and CSS. The focus was to use CSS to create a responsive layout, so that the webpage is able to be used across all devices, no matter the viewport size.

Some challenges I faced when building the project were positioning images properly using flex in the 'work' section of the webpage, and finding a user-friendly color palette that makes the website enjoyable to look at. Another tedious job I had once I finished the main build, was going over my CSS code to consolidate it and remove any unesseccary lines of code that were no longer performing a task due to updated code.

# Deployment

The website has been deployed via GitHub pages, and is accessible now via this link: https://thomasszentirmay.github.io/web-dev-portfolio/

# Usage

Functions like a regular single-page website. A nav bar fixed to the top of the screen will allow for easy direction to specific locations on the UI.

# Credits

HTML and CSS both written and heavily edited by author of the project, Thomas Szentirmay. External sources such as ChatGPT and StackOverflow where used for code snippets when I was stuck on CSS styling, or when I wanted tips about how I could further consolidate any code already written. 

An important aspect of using these external tools was to make sure that I, the author, knew what each line of code was doing to the website, and that I understood the help I was receiving. On multiple occasions, I would recieve a pointer from a forum or ChatGPT, and would add it to my code once I knew what it would do, but then it would break the application due to clashing with previously written code. It was then up to me to go through the CSS and debug any situations present.
